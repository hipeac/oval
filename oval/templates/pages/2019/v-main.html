        <p>Virtual assistants, like Siri, Alexa, Google, Bixby are deeply changing the way we interact with computers. They allow a more natural interaction and enable "computer illiterates" to access to services and to the web. However, this technology is mastered by few big players and often lock their users in closed ecosystems, with questions about the use of private data. It is very difficult for start-ups or even companies to make efficient assistants, and not obvious for researchers to integrate their results in such complex and closed systems. Like for the web, the technologies to create virtual assistants should be accessible, and their repository of "knowledge" should be interoperable.</p>
        <p>The Stanford OVAL Lab is leading a project to create a privacy preserving, open, trustworthy virtual assistant and an open linguistic web.  Academia and industry are invited to join in this effort to create an ecosystem where individual businesses own their voice interfaces, all the skills are available to a plethora of virtual assistants, offering users choice and privacy protection, without depending on a proprietary ecosystem.</p>
        <p>This workshop will present the vision, the new technical advances, infrastructures, and tools to accelerate natural language interfaces development, the open-source community and partners to date, how to participate, a hands-on tutorial, and the current roadmap. A session will be dedicated for interactive feedbacks and to work on the creation of an European ecosystem. The goal is to create a vibrant self-sustaining international ecosystem in three years, by building upon the fully functional open, federated, privacy-preserving virtual assistant prototype developed by the OVAL Lab.</p>
        <p>"The goal of this workshop is to inform the European community about the initiative, solicit feedback, trigger active collaborations to advance the technology and grow an European ecosystem.
        The First Open Virtual Assistant Workshop (https://almond.stanford.edu/blog/10-the-first-open-virtual-assistant-workshop) was held at Stanford on October 30, attended by 30 institutions including all the top virtual assistant providers.
